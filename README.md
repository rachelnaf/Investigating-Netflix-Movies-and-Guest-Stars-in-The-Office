# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office

In this guided project, I excersice my skills to solve  a real-world data science problem. The problem here, the average duration of movies has been declining over the years. So I'll try to understand the pattern by using using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

This project helps me gain knowledges in data science skill such as  exploratory data analysis, which allows me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots I create of the data.

# Project Tasks
Dig into a real-world Netflix movie dataset using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

1.  Project tasks
2.  Loading a friend's data into a dictionary
3.  Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
4.  A visual inspection of our data
5.  Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
6.  Filtering for movies!
7.  Creating a scatter plot
8.  Digging deeper
9.  Marking non-feature films
10. Plotting with color!
11. What next?

# Project task
1.  Create a matplotlib scatter plot of the data that contains the following attributes:

      ● Each episode's episode number plotted along the x-axis
  
      ● Each episode's viewership (in millions) plotted along the y-axis
      
      ● A color scheme reflecting the scaled ratings (not the regular ratings) of each episode, such that:
      
      ○ Ratings < 0.25 are colored "red"  
      
      ○ Ratings >= 0.25 and < 0.50 are colored "orange"
      
      ○ Ratings >= 0.50 and < 0.75 are colored "lightgreen"
      
      ○ Ratings >= 0.75 are colored "darkgreen"
     
     ● A sizing system, such that episodes with guest appearances have a marker size of 250 and episodes without are sized 25
     
     ● A title, reading "Popularity, Quality, and Guest Appearances on the Office"
     
     ● An x-axis label reading "Episode Number"
     
     ● A y-axis label reading "Viewership (Millions)"
      
     ● Provide the name of one of the guest stars (hint, there were multiple!) who was in the most watched Office episode.
