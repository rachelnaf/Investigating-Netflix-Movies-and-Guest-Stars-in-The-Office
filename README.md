# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office

In this guided project, I excersice my skills to solve  a real-world data science problem. The problem here, the average duration of movies has been declining over the years. So I'll try to understand the pattern by using using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

This project helps me gain knowledges in data science skill such as  exploratory data analysis, which allows me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots I create of the data.

# Guided project
